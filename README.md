Applications that support Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) include Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, After Effects, and Bridge. Additionally, Adobe Lightroom is built upon the same powerful raw image processing technology that powers Camera Raw.

## Key Features:

Raw Image Editing: ACR supports a vast range of raw file formats, allowing users to manipulate the original image data for maximum control and quality.

Non-Destructive Editing: All changes made in ACR are non-destructive, preserving the original raw file. This means you can always revert to the original state of your image.

White Balance Adjustment: Precisely adjust the color temperature and tint to correct any color casts in your images.

Exposure and Tone Control: Fine-tune exposure, highlights, shadows, contrast, and clarity to enhance image details and tonal range.

Color Grading: Use the powerful HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance) controls to manipulate individual color channels, giving you complete control over the look and feel of your images.

Lens Correction: Correct distortions, chromatic aberration, and vignetting caused by specific camera lenses.
